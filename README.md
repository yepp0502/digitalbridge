This website is created for the purpose of bridging the digital divide in Surabaya, Indonesia. The digital divide is still present in countries, like Indonesia. Because it limits the learning of many, especially due to the pandemic, it is vital to help those underprivileged children by donating.
The digital divide refers to "a gap between individuals, households, businesses and geographic areas at different socio-economic levels regarding their ability to access ICT (information and communication technology), as well as in terms of using the internet for various activities" (OECD, 2001). Despite Indonesia being the fourth largest country in internet use, approximately, only 19 percent of the whole  population of Indonesia owns a laptop or computer. The digital divide is affecting today's world more than ever as we are in the digital age and the pandemic limits people to communicate in person. Comfortable or wealthy children and families are equipped with technologies that enable sharing and learning during the pandemic. Because unprivileged children have limited access and therefore hinder the advancement of knowledge, it is vital for them to have at least some access. In order to bridge the gap, this non-profit organization strives to <br>donate computers to the rural side of Surabaya.
